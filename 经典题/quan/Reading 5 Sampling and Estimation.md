Perkiomen Kinzua, a seasoned auditor, is auditing last year’s
transactions for Conemaugh Corporation. Unfortunately, Conemaugh
had a very large number of transactions last year, and Kinzua is under a
time constraint to finish the audit. He decides to audit only the small
subset of the transaction population that is of interest and to use
sampling to create that subset.
The most appropriate sampling method for Kinzua to use is:
A. judgmental sampling.
B. systematic sampling.
C. convenience sampling


### 95

Which one of the following statements is true about non-probability
sampling?
A. There is significant risk that the sample is not representative of the
population.
B. Every member of the population has an equal chance of being
selected for the sample.
C. Using judgment guarantees that population subdivisions of
interest are represented in the sample

### 96

The best approach for creating a stratified random sample of a
population involves:
A. drawing an equal number of simple random samples from each
subpopulation.
B. selecting every kth member of the population until the desired
sample size is reached.
C. drawing simple random samples from each subpopulation in sizes
proportional to the relative size of each subpopulation

Suppose we take a random sample of 30 companies in an industry with
200 companies. We calculate the sample mean of the ratio of cash flow
to total debt for the prior year. We find that this ratio is 23%.
Subsequently, we learn that the population cash flow to total debt ratio
(taking account of all 200 companies) is 26%. What is the explanation
for the discrepancy between the sample mean of 23% and the
population mean of 26%?
A. Sampling error.
B. Bias.
C. A lack of consistency


### 97

A population has a non-normal distribution with mean μ and variance
σ2. The sampling distribution of the sample mean computed from
samples of large size from that population will have:
A. The same distribution as the population distribution.
B. Its mean approximately equal to the population mean.
C. Its variance approximately equal to the population variance.


### 98

A sample mean is computed from a population with a variance of 2.45.
The sample size is 40. The standard error of the sample mean is closest
to:
A. 0.039.
B. 0.247.
C. 0.387


### 98

An estimator with an expected value equal to the parameter that it is
intended to estimate is described as:
A. Efficient.
B. Unbiased.
C. Consistent.

### 99
If an estimator is consistent, an increase in sample size will increase the:
A. Accuracy of estimates.
B. Efficiency of the estimator.
C. Unbiasedness of the estimator.


### 100

For a two-sided confidence interval, an increase in the degree of
confidence will result in:
A. A wider confidence interval.
B. A narrower confidence interval.
C. No change in the width of the confidence interval.


### 100

For a sample size of 17, with a mean of 116.23 and a variance of 245.55,
the width of a 90% confidence interval using the appropriate t-
distribution is closest to:
A. 13.23.
B. 13.27.
C. 13.68.


### 101

For a sample size of 65 with a mean of 31 taken from a normally
distributed population with a variance of 529, a 99% confidence
interval for the population mean will have a lower limit closest to:
A. 23.64.
B. 25.41.
C. 30.09.


### 102

An increase in sample size is most likely to result in a:
A. Wider confidence interval.
B. Decrease in the standard error of the sample mean.
C. Lower likelihood of sampling from more than one population.

Otema Chi has a spreadsheet with 108 monthly returns for shares in
Marunou Corporation. He writes a software program that uses
bootstrap resampling to create 200 resamples of this Marunou data by
sampling with replacement. Each resample has 108 data points. Chi’s
program calculates the mean of each of the 200 resamples, and then it
calculates that the mean of these 200 resample means is 0.0261. The
program subtracts 0.0261 from each of the 200 resample means,
squares each of these 200 differences, and adds the squared
differences together. The result is 0.835. The program then calculates
an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean

The estimated standard error of the sample mean is closest to:
A. 0.0115
B. 0.0648
C. 0.0883



  
### 103

Compared with bootstrap resampling, jackknife resampling:
A. is done with replacement.
B. usually requires that the number of repetitions is equal to the
sample size.
C. produces dissimilar results for every run because resamples are
randomly drawn.


### 104



A report on long-term stock returns focused exclusively on all currently
publicly traded firms in an industry is most likely susceptible to:
A. Look-ahead bias.
B. Survivorship bias.
C. Intergenerational data mining.
### 105

Which sampling bias is most likely investigated with an out-of-sample
test?
A. Look-ahead bias
B. Data-mining bias
C. Sample selection bias




### 105

Which of the following characteristics of an investment study most
likely indicates time-period bias?
A. The study is based on a short time-series.
B. Information not available on the test date is used.
C. A structural change occurred prior to the start of the study’s time
series.
