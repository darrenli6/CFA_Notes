reaching test conclusions.


### 117

Which of the following represents a correct statement about the p-
value?

An investment consultant conducts two independent random samples
of five-year performance data for US and European absolute return
hedge funds. Noting a return advantage of 50 bps for US managers,
the consultant decides to test whether the two means are different
from one another at a 0.05 level of significance. The two populations
are assumed to be normally distributed with unknown but equal
variances. Results of the hypothesis test are contained in the following
tables.

Jill Batten is analyzing how the returns on the stock of Stellar Energy
Corp. are related with the previous month’s percentage change in the
US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG). Based on 248
observations, she has computed the sample correlation between the
Stellar and CPIENG variables to be −0.1452. She also wants to
determine whether the sample correlation is significantly different from
zero. The critical value for the test statistic at the 0.05 level of
significance is approximately 1.96.

Batten should conclude that the statistical relationship between Stellar
and CPIENG is:
A. significant, because the calculated test statistic is outside the
bounds of the critical values for the test statistic.
B. significant, because the calculated test statistic has a lower
absolute value than the critical value for the test statistic.
C. insignificant, because the calculated test statistic is outside the
bounds of the critical values for the test statistic


### 125

In which of the following situations would a non-parametric test of a

B. The sample data come from a normally distributed population.

of the population.

### 127
