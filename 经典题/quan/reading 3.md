An analyst estimates that 20% of high-risk bonds will fail (go bankrupt).
If she applies a bankruptcy prediction model, she finds that 70% of the
bonds will receive a “good” rating, implying that they are less likely to
fail. Of the bonds that failed, only 50% had a “good” rating. Use Bayes’
formula to predict the probability of failure given a “good” rating. (Hint,
let P(A) be the probability of failure, P(B) be the probability of a “good”
rating, P(B | A) be the likelihood of a “good” rating given failure, and
P(A | B) be the likelihood of failure given a “good” rating.)

is the probability that a CEO will be fired given “good” performance? (Hint, let
P(A) be the probability of a CEO being fired, P(B) be the probability of a “good”
performance rating, P(B | A) be the likelihood of a “good” performance rating
given that the CEO was fired, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of the CEO being
