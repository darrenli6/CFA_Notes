z An analyst is examining the annual growth of the money supply for a
country over the past 30 years. This country experienced a central bank
policy shift 15 years ago, which altered the approach to the
management of the money supply. The analyst estimated a model
using the annual growth rate in the money supply regressed on the
variable (SHIFT) that takes on a value of 0 before the policy shift and 1
after. She estimated the following:

z Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar
Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world’s largest companies,
Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his
analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock’s returns to
various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub
whether the price of Stellar Energy Corp. stock has tended to rise
following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the
association between the two variables is negative, but he does not
know the strength of the association.

The following information relates to Questions 1-5
z Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships
between (1) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous
month’s percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy
(CPIENG) and (2) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the
previous month’s percentage change in the US Producer Price Index for
Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a
correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten
compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for 248 months.

independent variable. Exhibit 2 displays the results of this regression
model.

z Anh Liu is an analyst researching whether a company’s debt burden
affects investors’ decision to short the company’s stock. She
calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to
average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as
of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies’
debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in
decimal form)


 The following information relates to Questions 1-9
z Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a
simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a

observations using a scatter plot, with the short interest ratio on
the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

z Doug Abitbol is a portfolio manager for Polyi Investments, a hedge fund
that trades in the United States. Abitbol manages the hedge fund with the
help of Robert Olabudo, a junior portfolio manager.
z Abitbol looks at economists’ inflation forecasts and would like to examine
the relationship between the US Consumer Price Index (US CPI) consensus
forecast and the actual US CPI using regression analysis. Olabudo estimates
regression coefficients to test whether the consensus forecast is unbiased. If
the consensus forecasts are unbiased, the intercept should be 0.0 and the
slope will be equal to 1.0.

no matter the US CPI consensus forecast.
z Observation 2 A larger standard error of the estimate will result in a wider
confidence interval.
