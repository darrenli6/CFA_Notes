Scott works for a regional brokerage firm. He estimates that Walkton
Industries will increase its dividend by US$1.50 a share during the next year.
He realizes that this increase is contingent on pending legislation that
would, if enacted, give Walkton a substantial tax break. The US
representative for Walkton’s home district has told Scott that, although she
is lobbying hard for the bill and prospects for its passage are favorable,
concern of the US Congress over the federal deficit could cause the tax bill
to be voted down. Walkton Industries has not made any statements about
a change in dividend policy. Scott writes in his research report, “We expect
Walkton’s stock price to rise by at least US$8.00 a share by the end of the
year because the dividend will increase by US$1.50 a share. Investors
buying the stock at the current time should expect to realize a total return
of at least 15% on the stock.”

According to the Standards:


A. Scott violated the Standards because he used material inside
information.

B. Scott violated the Standards because he failed to separate opinion
from fact.

C. Scott violated the Standards by basing his research on uncertain
predictions of future government action.

One of the discretionary accounts managed by Farnsworth is the Jones
Corporation employee profit-sharing plan. Jones, the company president,
recently asked Farnsworth to vote the shares in the profit-sharing plan in
favor of the slate of directors nominated by Jones Corporation and against
the directors sponsored by a dissident stockholder group. Farnsworth does
not want to lose this account because he directs all the account’s trades to
a brokerage firm that provides Farnsworth with useful information about
tax-free investments. Although this information is not of value in managing
the Jones Corporation account, it does help in managing several other
accounts. The brokerage firm providing this information also offers the
lowest commissions for trades and provides best execution. Farnsworth
investigates the director issue, concludes that the management-nominated
slate is better for the long-run performance of the company than the
dissident group’s slate, and votes accordingly.

Farnsworth:
A. Violated the Standards in voting the shares in the manner requested
by Jones but not in directing trades to the brokerage firm.
B. Did not violate the Standards in voting the shares in the manner
requested by Jones or in directing trades to the brokerage firm.

record yet, but I’m sure that you’ll be very pleased with my
recommendations and service. In the three years that I’ve been in the
business, my equity-oriented clients have averaged a total return of
more than 26% a year.” The statement is true, but Michelieu only has a
