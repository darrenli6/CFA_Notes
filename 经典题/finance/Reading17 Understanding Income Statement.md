A.  Stock options.

B.   Convertible debt that is dilutive.

C.  Convertible preferred stock that is dilutive.


my answer  A  

??

When  a  company  has  stock  options  outstanding,  diluted  EPS  iscalculated  as  if  the  financial  instruments  had  been  exercised  andthe  company  had  used  the  proceeds  from  the  exercise  torepurchase  as  many  shares  possible  at  the  weighted  averagemarket price of common stock during the period. As a result, theconversion  of  stock  options  increases  the  number  of  commonshares  outstanding  but  has  no  effect  on  net  income  available  tocommon  shareholders.  The  conversion  of  convertible  debtincreases the net income available to common shareholders by theafter-tax  amount  of  interest  expense  saved.  The  conversion  ofconvertible preferred shares increases the net income available tocommon shareholders by the amount of preferred dividends paid;the numerator becomes the net income
