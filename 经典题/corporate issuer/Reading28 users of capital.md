Bouchard Industries is a Canadian company that manufactures gutters
for residential houses. Its management believes it has developed a new
process that produces a superior product. The company must make an
initial investment of C$190 million to begin production. If demand is

high, cash flows are expected to be C$40 million per year. If demand is
low, cash flows will be only C$20 million per year. Management
believes there is an equal chance that demand will be high or low. The

investment also gives the company a production- flexibility option
allowing the company to add shifts at the end of the first year if
demand turns out to be high. If the company exercises this option, net

cash flows would increase by an additional C$5million in Years 2–10.
Bouchard’s opportunity cost of funds is 10%


The internal auditor for Bouchard Industries has made two suggestions
for improving capital allocation processes at the company. The internal
auditor’s suggestions are as follows:
z Suggestion 1 “In order to treat all capital allocation proposals in a
fair manner, the investments should all use the risk- free rate for the
required rate of return.”
z Suggestion 2 “When rationing capital, it is better to choose the
portfolio of investments that maximizes the company NPV than the
portfolio that maximizes the company IRR


What is the NPV (C$ millions) of the original project for Bouchard
Industries without considering the production- flexibility option?


A. –C$6.11million

B. –C$5.66million

C. C$2.33million
