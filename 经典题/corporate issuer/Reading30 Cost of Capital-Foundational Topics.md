Brandon Wiene is a financial analyst covering the beverage industry. He
is evaluating the impact of DEF Beverage's new product line of flavored
waters. DEF currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6. The new
product line would be financed with $50 million of debt and $100
million of equity. In estimating the valuation impact of this new product
line on DEF's value, Wiene has estimated the equity beta and asset beta
of comparable companies. In calculating the equity beta for the
product line, Wiene is intending to use DEF's existing capital structure
when converting the asset beta into a project beta. Which of the
following statements is correct?

A. Using DEF's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6 is appropriate in calculating
the new product line's equity beta.


B. Using DEF's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6 is not appropriate, but
rather the debt-to-equity ratio of the new product, 0.5, is
appropriate to use in calculating the new product line's equity beta.

C. Wiene should use the new debt-to-equity ratio of DEF that would
result from the additional $50 million debt and $100 million equity
in calculating the new product line's equity beta

Happy Resorts Company currently has 1.2 million common shares of
stock outstanding and the stock has a beta of 2.2. It also has $10
million face value of bonds that have five years remaining to maturity

Jurgen Knudsen has been hired to provide industry expertise to Henrik
Sandell, CFA, an analyst for a pension plan managing a global large-
cap fund internally. Sandell is concerned about one of the fund's larger
holdings, auto parts manufacturer Kruspa AB. Kruspa currently operates
in 80 countries, with the previous year's global revenues at €5.6 billion.
Recently, Kruspa’s CFO announced plans for expansion into Trutan, a
country with a developing economy. Sandell worries that this
expansion will change the company's risk profile and wonders if he
should recommend a sale of the position.
Sandell provides Knudsen with the basic information. Kruspa’s global
annual free cash flow to the firm is €500 million and earnings are €400
million. Sandell estimates that cash flow will level off at a 2 percent rate
of growth. Sandell also estimates that Kruspa’s after-tax free cash flow


to the firm on the Trutan project for next three years is, respectively,
€48 million, €52 million, and €54.4 million. Kruspa recently announced
a dividend of €4.00 per share of stock. For the initial analysis, Sandell
requests that Knudsen ignore possible currency fluctuations. He
expects the Trutanese plant to sell only to customers within Trutan for
the first three years. Knudsen is asked to evaluate Kruspa’s planned
financing of the required €100 million with a €80 million public offering
of 10-year debt in Sweden and the remainder with an equity offering

Boris Duarte, CFA, covers initial public offerings for Zellweger Analytics,
an independent research firm specializing in global small-cap equities.
He has been asked to evaluate the upcoming new issue of TagOn, a
US-based business intelligence software company. The industry has
grown at 26 percent per year for the previous three years. Large
companies dominate the market, but sizable “pure-play” companies
such as Relevant, Ltd., ABJ, Inc., and Opus Software Pvt. Ltd also
compete. Each of these competitors is domiciled in a different country,
but they all have shares of stock that trade on the US NASDAQ. The
debt ratio of the industry has risen slightly in recent years

![image.png](https://note.youdao.com/yws/res/57401/WEBRESOURCE0a96f5f26bd89aed03dd600af9c57569)

TagOn’s initial offering. The company intends to issue 1 million new
shares. In his conversation with the investment bankers for the deal, he
concludes the offering price will be between $7 and $12. The current
capital structure of TagOn consists of a $2.4 million five-year non-
callable bond issue and 1 million common shares. Other information

SebCoe plc, a British firm, is evaluating an investment in a ο50 million
project that will be financed with 50% debt and 50% equity.
Management has already determined that the NPV of this project is
ο 5 million if it uses internally generated equity. However, if the
company uses external equity, it will incur flotation costs of 5.8%.
Assuming flotation costs are not tax deductible, the NPV using external
equity would be:
A. less than ο5 million because we would discount the cash flows
using a higher weighted average cost of capital that reflects the
flotation costs.
B. ο3.55 million because flotation costs reduce NPV by $1.45 million.
C. ο5 million because flotation costs have no impact on NPV


#### correct B
