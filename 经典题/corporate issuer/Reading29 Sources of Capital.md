Kwam Solutions must raise €120 million. Kwam has two primary sources of
liquidity: €60 million of marketable securities (which can be sold with

minimal liquidation/brokerage costs) and €30 million of bonds (which can
be sold with 3% liquidation costs). Kwam can sell some or all of either of
these portfolios. Kwam has a secondary source of liquidity, which would be

to sell a large piece of real estate valued at €70 million (which would incur

10% liquidation costs). If Kwam sells the real estate, it must be sold entirely
(a fractional sale is not possible). What is the lowest cost strategy for
raising the needed €120 million?
